Hey welcome to blog. here's some stuff i've been working on

## games

My main project right now is a game called Roobos,

The game is a big exploration of playstation 1 aesthetics and gameplay, after being inspired by recent research I've been doing into the console. It's a fascinating time for gamedev, with a ton of unique ideas that never seemed to have been followed through with in future gens. also i love to Write Bangers and this is a great platform to do so

## 3d art

I keep trying to develop my 3d art skills, for both Roobos and other ideas for games and music videos, but continually struggle with creating humanoids. To work around this recently I started experimenting with more abstract designs, to get more personality and deal less with accurate proportions. I've really been enjoying this process so far!

Rigging/animating was simple enough, and creating new characters and little scenes with this stylised aesthetic has been a ton of fun to play with
